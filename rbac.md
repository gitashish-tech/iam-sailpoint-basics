# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an access control model where permissions
are assigned to roles instead of individual users.

Users receive access based on their job role, department, or responsibility.

Benefits of RBAC:
- Simplifies access management
- Enforces least privilege
- Reduces access violations
- Improves audit compliance
