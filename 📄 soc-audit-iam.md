# SOC Audit and IAM

SOC (System and Organization Controls) audits evaluate how well an organization
protects data and manages access controls.

IAM plays a key role in SOC audits by ensuring:
- Proper access approvals
- Documented access reviews
- Timely access revocation
- Audit-ready evidence

Effective IAM implementation helps achieve SOC compliance.
