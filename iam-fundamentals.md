# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a security framework that ensures
the right users have the right access to the right resources at the right time.

IAM focuses on:
- User identity management
- Access control and authorization
- Governance and compliance
- Risk reduction

IAM helps organizations prevent unauthorized access, reduce insider threats,
and meet audit and compliance requirements.
